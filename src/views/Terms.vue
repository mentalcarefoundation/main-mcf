                We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service to, for example, reflect changes
                to the law or changes to our Services. You should look at the terms regularly. We’ll post notice of
                modifications to these terms on this page. We’ll post notice of modified additional terms in the applicable
                Service. Changes addressing new functions for a Service or changes made for legal reasons will be
                effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified terms for a Service, you should immediately
                discontinue your use of that Service.
                <br />
                <br />If there is a conflict between these terms and the additional terms, the additional terms will control for that

                <br />These terms control the relationship between FITILA and you. They do not create any third party beneficiary
                rights.
                <br />
                <br />If you do not comply with these terms, and we don’t take action right away, that doesn’t mean that we will
                give up any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future).
                <br />
                <br />If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms. The laws of Nigeria
                will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services.
